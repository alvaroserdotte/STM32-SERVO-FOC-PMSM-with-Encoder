# Stm32-Servo-FOC-PMSM-with-Encoder
I made this inverter to experiment the servo motor FOC algorithm. As you can see in the files I made it with Keil MDK and STM32CUBEMX with STM32F103. This software version is not the final version, I want to add another things like NRF24L01 Communication.

Remember to use it with care, we are dealing with high voltage 220AC and it is very dangerous.
